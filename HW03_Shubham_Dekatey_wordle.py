#   The UI file imports Dictionary file
#   The dictionary file has only 1 function to filter and return a random 5 letter word
#   Also, we can use the commented lines to get any random word from the list and the entire code would still work
#   The wordle file imports UI
#   First we establish a new random word, which is the question
#   Then a loop is run 6 times for 6 attempts of user input
#   This is done by calling acceptInput function from UI file
#   After accepting the input similar validation is performed from last submission
#   a valid input is then sent to the checker function in Wordle file
#   Checking is similar to last submission
#   with the changes introduced in last lecture (blank - correct; ["] - incorrect position, and [`] - incorrect letter)
#
#   Following is a sample output
#
# Correct: ANGER
# Attempt:  1
# Enter your value (Only first 5 characters will be considered): angel
# Your word: angel
# Enter [y/n]: y
# Processing word:  ANGEL
# ANGEL
#     `
# Attempt:  2
# Enter your value (Only first 5 characters will be considered): ajorb
# Your word: ajorb
# Enter [y/n]: y
# Processing word:  AJORB
# AJORB
#  ``"`
# Attempt:  3
# Enter your value (Only first 5 characters will be considered): angel
# Your word: angel
# Enter [y/n]: y
# Similar attempt exists.
# Attempts:  ['angel', 'ajorb']
# Re-enter the word
# Enter your value (Only first 5 characters will be considered): mango
# Your word: mango
# Enter [y/n]: y
# Processing word:  MANGO
# MANGO
# `"""`
# Attempt:  4
# Enter your value (Only first 5 characters will be considered): paris
# Your word: paris
# Enter [y/n]: y
# Processing word:  PARIS
# PARIS
# `""``
# Attempt:  5
# Enter your value (Only first 5 characters will be considered): anisl
# Your word: anisl
# Enter [y/n]: y
# Processing word:  ANISL
# ANISL
#   ```
# Attempt:  6
# Enter your value (Only first 5 characters will be considered): yorke
# Your word: yorke
# Enter [y/n]: y
# Processing word:  YORKE

#   The UI file imports Dictionary file
#   The dictionary file has only 1 function to filter and return a random 5 letter word
#   Also, we can use the commented lines to get any random word from the list and the entire code would still work
#   The wordle file imports UI
#   First we establish a new random word, which is the question
#   Then a loop is run 6 times for 6 attempts of user input
#   This is done by calling acceptInput function from UI file
#   After accepting the input similar validation is performed from last submission
#   a valid input is then sent to the checker function in Wordle file
#   Checking is similar to last submission
#   with the changes introduced in last lecture (blank - correct; ["] - incorrect position, and [`] - incorrect letter)
#
#   Following is a sample output
